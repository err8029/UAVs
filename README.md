# UAVs

**EO sensor prototyping program**

1.-Clone the entire repo

2.-Run the file EO_sensorGUI.m

3.-The main window will show up

4.-Check Jhonson's criteria 95%, DB contains criteria for 3 modes and 4 objects:
  - Modes: Detect, recognise and ID modes
  - Objects: Truck, car, tank and human

6.-Check input data
  - H: 5000 ft by default
  - Veq1: 10 cm by default
  - Veq2: 20 cm by default
  
5.-Click the start calculus buton

6.-A window will pop up, giving info about minimum resolution for your parameters

7.-Find a sensor that satisfy the minimum resolution requirements

8.-Introduce it and the process will end showing all the UAS and sensor data, plus the R:
  - If the R field has a red font color the R is bigger than the minimum, not a valid sensor or parameters, but if it is black its valid and good to go
